# To-do-list
A "To-Do List" using HTML is a simple, interactive web page where users can add, view, and remove tasks.  Each task might has a checkbox to mark it as complete and a button to delete it from the list. The HTML structure is often enhanced with CSS for styling and JavaScript for interactivity.
